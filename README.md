# Tools for manipulating the ISBTF LXX-NT database

This project aims at collecting the database entries from ISBTF's LXX-NT
project and saving them as bibref statements. The project is a work in progress.

To run module_demo.py, you need to have the bibref Python module also.
You can find it in https://github.com/kovzol/bibref, folder "py".
