# An ad-hoc BRST database of ISBTF's LXX-NT project

These files have been created with the script `../generate-brst.py` and
the `runme-graphviz` program from the
[bibref](https://github.com/kovzol/bibref)'s project `statements/tests` folder.

Currently, only the simplest entries are processed, and there is no
improvement on the output files, even if there may be straightforward
ideas to do that. Improving these outputs is a work in progress.
